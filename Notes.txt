Pipet twister - goes HIGH after the wheel has traveled 25 percent of its movement to the next position (in this case 75 steps but use a percentage to calculate). Pipet twister will go LOW for after the 75 percent of its time stopped (in this case we have a delay in which the motor is paused waiting for actions to be performed but use a percentage of that delay).

The air ram goes high after 5 percent of the time in which the motor has stopped (begun its delay). The pipet ram will go back to LOW after 90 percent of motor stop/delay has passed. 

Keep logic to home the pipet twister using the sensor. This will give a good starting point. 






Todo: 

--------


soemtyhijgn  still in slot sensor dont put anything in here


-------------


Power for mechanics off but arduino is on should pikc this up and hault all processes.  


caps arent allowing to go in

Makes it to check if an errored on is ejected and it was then clear slot errors, reset empty values and junk values...otherwise stop machine.

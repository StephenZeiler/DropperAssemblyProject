Pipet twister - goes HIGH after the wheel has traveled 25 percent of its movement to the next position (in this case 75 steps but use a percentage to calculate). Pipet twister will go LOW for after the 75 percent of its time stopped (in this case we have a delay in which the motor is paused waiting for actions to be performed but use a percentage of that delay).

The air ram goes high after 5 percent of the time in which the motor has stopped (begun its delay). The pipet ram will go back to LOW after 90 percent of motor stop/delay has passed. 

Keep logic to home the pipet twister using the sensor. This will give a good starting point. 






Todo: 

Empty stop - When this button is pushed go to home but finish production. We need to close capFeed once stop.

One step mode - push button and it moves one step at a time assembling

Releasing caps - When motor finds home for the first time then we need it to open cap shoot and pause one second. This will allow a cap to get in the first slot before assembly begins. pin 35. capFeed. 

Log error and caution 

what happens if bulb isnt present and machine stops? Does it slam down when a bulb is detected? Or go pause 


PIN - 31

pipetTipSensor = low then it can continue

if high then it needs to kick out in in junk 

the sensor is at slot 10 

junk ejector is slot 14

________


Slot 2 cap confirm - 

PIN - 29

capInSlotSensor LOW when cap is succcesfullyt injected.

HIGH means it was not injected. 

When it was not injected we dont want pipet or bulb place in slot and try again when it comes back around.
